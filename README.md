# ðŸ§“ Age Guessing Game

A fun and simple Python-based command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected age between 18 and 30. If you're looking for a small project to sharpen your Python skillsâ€”this one's got recursion, randomness, and input validation all in one.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- When the game starts, it randomly selects a secret age between 18 and 30.
- The player enters guesses until they get it right.
- The game gives hints if the guess is too high or too low.
- On a correct guess:
  - You can press `0` to exit
  - Or any other key to play again with a new number

## ðŸ§  Features

- Uses **recursion** to loop through guesses
- Handles invalid input (e.g., non-integer guesses)
- Automatically restarts or exits based on user input
- Lightweight and easy to run in any terminal
